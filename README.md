# Self-Project

A white-and-blue, tech-styled portfolio website (home page + projects page) served by Express.js.

## Design

The layout comes from the "Portfolio Landing Page" design, re-themed with a white/blue tech look:
- White and blue-tinted neutral background with a blue accent (`#1F6FEB`) and a cyan secondary (`#00A8CC`)
- Faint blueprint grid and soft blue glow behind the page
- Space Grotesk headings, Work Sans body, JetBrains Mono for labels, chips and code-style details (Google Fonts)
- Sticky, blurred navigation bar with a `~/Kiki` brand and blinking cursor
- Terminal-style card in the home hero
- Two-column sections: a small mono `//` label on the left, content on the right
- White cards with hairline blue borders and a glowing hover state
- Dark navy contact band and footer with a grid pattern
- Responsive, with breakpoints at 900px and 720px
